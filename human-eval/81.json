The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.\n    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.\n    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write \n    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:\n             GPA       |    Letter grade\n              4.0                A+\n            > 3.7                A \n            > 3.3                A- \n            > 3.0                B+\n            > 2.7                B \n            > 2.3                B-\n            > 2.0                C+\n            > 1.7                C\n            > 1.3                C-\n            > 1.0                D+ \n            > 0.7                D \n            > 0.0                D-\n              0.0                E\n    \n\n    Example:\n    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']\n    \"\"\"\n", "entry_point": "numerical_letter_grade", "canonical_solution": "\n   \n    letter_grade = []\n    for gpa in grades:\n        if gpa == 4.0:\n            letter_grade.append(\"A+\")\n        elif gpa > 3.7:\n            letter_grade.append(\"A\")\n        elif gpa > 3.3:\n            letter_grade.append(\"A-\")\n        elif gpa > 3.0:\n            letter_grade.append(\"B+\")\n        elif gpa > 2.7:\n            letter_grade.append(\"B\")\n        elif gpa > 2.3:\n            letter_grade.append(\"B-\")\n        elif gpa > 2.0:\n            letter_grade.append(\"C+\")\n        elif gpa > 1.7:\n            letter_grade.append(\"C\")\n        elif gpa > 1.3:\n            letter_grade.append(\"C-\")\n        elif gpa > 1.0:\n            letter_grade.append(\"D+\")\n        elif gpa > 0.7:\n            letter_grade.append(\"D\")\n        elif gpa > 0.0:\n            letter_grade.append(\"D-\")\n        else:\n            letter_grade.append(\"E\")\n    return letter_grade\n", "test": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) == ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']\n    assert candidate([1.2]) == ['D+']\n    assert candidate([0.5]) == ['D-']\n    assert candidate([0.0]) == ['E']\n    assert candidate([1, 0.3, 1.5, 2.8, 3.3]) == ['D', 'D-', 'C-', 'B', 'B+']\n    assert candidate([0, 0.7]) == ['E', 'D-']"}
